## This project demonstrates basic core concepts of GitHub Actions flow
### Overview 
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

### Getting Started
- Node.js and npm must be installed on your system.
- You can clone the repo and run `npm install`
- To start the application in development mode, use the "dev" script. This will use Vite to bundle and serve the application: `npm run dev`
- Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified).
- To lint your source code and automatically fix any fixable issues, run the following command: `npm run lint`
- To create a production-ready build of your application, run the following command: `npm run build`
- To run tests for your application, use the following command: `npm test`
